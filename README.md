## Abstract: ##
Understanding the “hard” side of IT is a fairly simple prospect.  The skills, processes and technology tend to be simpler to grasp for us tech heads.  But what about the soft side?  The communication, team composition, and leadership... even an individuals happiness can have a huge impact on a project being a success or not.  I’d like to take a journey on an often overlooked aspect of IT: The human aspect.  We’ll look at how being human in a technological day to day can affect the outcomes of a project, and what we can do to allow more humanity into our daily, digital lives for the betterment of everything we do!
