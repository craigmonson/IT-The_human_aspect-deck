## Abstract: ##
Understanding the “hard” side of IT is a fairly simple prospect.  The skills, processes and technology tend to be simpler to grasp for us tech heads.  But what about the soft side?  The communication, team composition, and leadership... even an individuals happiness can have a huge impact on a project being a success or not.  I’d like to take a journey on an often overlooked aspect of IT: The human aspect.  We’ll look at how being human in a technological day to day can affect the outcomes of a project, and what we can do to allow more humanity into our daily, digital lives for the betterment of everything we do!

## Notes ##
**About Me:** I've been doing tech for many years, mostly in a developer role.  My first introduction to SCRUM was a resounding success, and I've been a proponent of Lean thinking ever since.  To me, the latest shift to DevOps is a maturation of what has been happening in the development community for many years.  This brought me to my belief that _HOW_ we get things done is just as important as _WHAT_ we get done, and is why I love reading and learning about the importance of culture and leadership, especially as it pertains to a DevOps transformation!  My previous roles as both a leader and a consultant, have given me great opportunities to experience, first hand, how culture and leadership can affect teams and projects, for better or for worse.
